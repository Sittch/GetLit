Comprehensibility Rankings for Target Language Texts

This is a program that allows a language learner to import texts in
their target language and see which are most appropriate for them
to read next. Appropriateness is based how many words in the text
they will already be familiar with, as well as the frequency of the
new words that they will have to learn. We may try to incorporate
grammar as well.
